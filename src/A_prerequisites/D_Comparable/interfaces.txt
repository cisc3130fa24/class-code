Interface: similar to an abstract class.

The main differences between abstract classes and interfaces are:
1. An interface cannot have "state" (instance fields); an abstract class can.
2. A class cannot directly extend multiple abstract classes,
   but a class can directly inherit from multiple interfaces.

In older versions of Java, there was another important difference:
interfaces were not allowed to contain any concrete (non-abstract) methods.
But since Java 7 or 8, they can. So nowadays, both abstract classes and interfaces
can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. Still, there is a difference:
- In an abstract class, an instance method is concrete unless marked "abstract".
- In an interface, an instance method is abstract unless marked "default".
Both abstract classes and interfaces can contain static methods, marked "static".

Another difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that
interface methods are public unless marked "private",
whereas abstract class methods (like regular class methods) are not public by default.

Class: data type with behavior (methods) and state (instance fields).
Interface: data type with behavior but no state.

Elaboration:

A class:
- specifies a type (the class name) and its operations (instance method headers)
- and implements the type with instance fields and the bodies of instance methods
- a class combines specification with implementation

An interface:
- specifies a type (the interface name) and its operations (instance method headers)
- does not contain full implementation
    - implementation is deferred to classes that inherit from ("implement")
      the interface
- typically contains abstract methods, which are simply instance method headers;
  non-abstract instance methods must be marked as "default"

When a class implements an interface,
it must override all abstract methods inherited from the interface
(unless the class is itself an abstract class).

One common purpose of an interface is to build a common trait into
multiple classes that don't have much in common.
For example, many unrelated types of objects have the property of being comparable,
meaning that given  a and b, a is either less than b, greater than b, or equal to b.
For example, Strings are comparable, Integers are comparable, etc.
These classes all implement an interface named Comparable,
which specifies a method named compareTo.

The compareTo method gets invoked like this: a.compareTo(b). It returns:
- a negative int if a is before/less than b
- a positive int if a is after/greater than b
- 0 if a and b are equal
